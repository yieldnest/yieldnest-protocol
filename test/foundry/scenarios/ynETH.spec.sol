Usage Scenarios

Scenario 1: Successful ETH Deposit and Share Minting
Objective: Test that a user can deposit ETH and receive the correct amount of shares in return

Scenario 2: Deposit Paused
Objective: Ensure that deposits are correctly paused and resumed, preventing or allowing ETH deposits accordingly.

Scenario 3: Withdraw ETH to Staking Nodes Manager
Objective: Test that only the Staking Nodes Manager can withdraw ETH from the contract.

Scenario 4: Share Accouting and Yield Accrual
Objective: Verify that the share price correctly increases after the contract earns yield.

Scenario 5: Emergency Withdrawal of ETH
Objective: Ensure that users can withdraw their ETH in case of an emergency, bypassing the normal withdrawal restrictions.

Scenario 6: Validator and Staking Node Administration
Objective: Test the ynETH's ability to update the address of the Staking Nodes Manager.

Scenario 7: Accrual and Distribution of Fees
Objective: Ensure that ynETH correctly accrues and distributes fees from yield earnings or other sources.

Scenario 8: Staking Rewards Distribution
Objective: Test the distribution of staking rewards to share holders.

Scenario 9: EigenLayer Accounting and Distribution
Objective: Verify that ynETH correctly accounts for and withdrawals from EigenLayer.


Invariant Scenarios

1. Total Assets Consistency
assert(totalDepositedInPool + totalDepositedInValidators() == totalAssets());

3. Exchange Rate Integrity
assert(exchangeAdjustmentRate >= 0 && exchangeAdjustmentRate <= BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR);

4. Share Minting Consistency
assert(totalSupply() == previousTotalSupply + mintedShares);

5. Deposit and Withdrawal Symmetry
uint256 sharesMinted = depositETH(amount);
assert(sharesMinted == previewDeposit(amount));

6. Rewards Increase Total Assets
uint256 previousTotalAssets = totalAssets();
// Simulate receiving rewards
receiveRewards{value: rewardAmount}();
assert(totalAssets() == previousTotalAssets + rewardAmount);

7. Authorized Access Control
// For any role-restricted operation
assert(msg.sender == authorizedRoleAddress);
