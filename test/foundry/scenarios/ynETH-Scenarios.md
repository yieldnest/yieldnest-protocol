## Usage Scenario Tests

These tests are designed to verify the correct behavior of the ynETH contract in various usage scenarios.

**Scenario 1:** Successful ETH Deposit and Share Minting

Objective: Test that a user can deposit ETH and receive the correct amount of shares in return.

**Scenario 2:** Deposit Paused

Objective: Ensure that deposits are correctly paused and resumed, preventing or allowing ETH deposits accordingly.

**Scenario 3:** Withdraw ETH to Staking Nodes Manager

Objective: Test that only the Staking Nodes Manager can withdraw ETH from the contract.

**Scenario 4:** Share Accouting and Yield Accrual

Objective: Verify that the share price correctly increases after the contract earns yield from consensus and execution rewards.

**Scenario 5:** Emergency Withdrawal of ETH

Objective: Test ability to withdraw all assets from eigenpods.

**Scenario 6:** Validator and Staking Node Administration

Objective: Test the ynETH's ability to update the address of the Staking Nodes Manager.

**Scenario 7:** Accrual and Distribution of Fees

Objective: Ensure that ynETH correctly accrues and distributes fees from yield earnings from execution and consensus rewards.

**Scenario 8:** Staking Rewards Distribution

Objective: Test the distribution of staking rewards to a multisig.

**Scenario 9:** EigenLayer Accounting and Distribution

Objective: Verify that ynETH correctly accounts for fund balances and withdrawals from EigenLayer.

## Invariant Scenarios

The following invariant scenarios are designed to verify the correct behavior of the ynETH contract in various usage scenarios. These scenarios should never fail, and if they do, it indicates there is an implementation issue somewhere in the protocol.

**Total Assets Consistency**

```solidity
assert(totalDepositedInPool + totalDepositedInValidators() == totalAssets());
```

**Exchange Rate Integrity**

```solidity
assert(exchangeAdjustmentRate >= 0 && exchangeAdjustmentRate <= BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR);
```
**Share Minting Consistency**

```solidity
assert(totalSupply() == previousTotalSupply + mintedShares)
```

**User Shares Integrity**

```solidity
assert(balanceOf(user) == previousUserSharesBalance + newUserSharesBalance);
```

**Total Deposited Integrity**

```solidity
assert(totalDepositedInValidators() == previousTotalDeposited + newDeposit);
```

**Total Assets Integrity**

```solidity
assert(totalAssets() == previousTotalAssets + newDeposit);
```

**Total Balance Integrity**

```solidity
assert(address(yneth).balance() == previousBalance + newBalance);
```

**Deposit and Withdrawal Symmetry**

```solidity
uint256 sharesMinted = depositETH(amount);
assert(sharesMinted == previewDeposit(amount));
```

**Rewards Increase Total Assets**

```solidity
uint256 previousTotalAssets = totalAssets();
// Simulate receiving rewards
receiveRewards{value: rewardAmount}();
assert(totalAssets() == previousTotalAssets + rewardAmount);
```

**Authorized Access Control**

```solidity
// For any role-restricted operation
assert(msg.sender == authorizedRoleAddress);
```
